Dear Mr. Doe:

          I am writing you concerning a recent purchase of widgets. Approximately two weeks ago, on
October 1, I ordered a total of 50 widgets for Company, Inc. via the Widgets Galore client webpage. I
received an email notification two days later confirming the receipt of payment and the shipment of the
 widgets.
          According to your website, shipments should reach their destination within 3-5 business days of
being sent, but I have yet to receive the widgets. Do you have any information on what may have
happened to delay the shipment or where the shipment is currently?

          I have worked with Widgets Galore, Inc. in the past and have the greatest confidence in your
products and customer service. We need the shipment of widgets soon, however, and I hoped you
might be able to provide me with an idea of when I can expect them. Thank you in advance for any help
you might be able to offer.

Sincerely,

Sam Brown
Vice President of Company, Inc.
